# cross-chat

Our application cross chat solves the problme of Interporterablity and Dependence of differnet blockchains. The project bridges the differnet blockchains using the CrossTalk library of Router Protocol.

The smart contracts are deployed on all the chains(currently three) and implement the functionality of basic user addition and sending a message. 

Any user can create a account by logging in using his/her wallet. After being logged in the user can add chats with users from across chains to his app and share information with them. Cross Chat provides full immersive experience of chatting crossc chain.
